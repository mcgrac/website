								<h2><a href="#">Mario bros</a></h2>
								<p>
									Super Mario Bros is a platformer game. It was developed by Nintendo for the NES console and launched in 1985 in Japan , in 1986 in the United States, and finally in 1987 in Europe.<br />
									Super Mario Bros is the successor to the arcade game Mario Bros, launched in 1983, and the first in the Sega Super Mario series. <br />
									The director and producer of the game was Shigeru Miyamoto, who also worked as an artist on the game. <br />
									The idea for Super Mario Bros emerged because Miyamoto wanted to create a colorful platformer game inspired by Pac-Land, an arcade game from 1984.

							<!-- Marc section -->
							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h2>Marc</h2>
								<p>
									Marc was responsible for several core gameplay systems. He implemented the player’s (Mario’s) movement, including walking left and right as well as jumping. He also developed the collision detection system using a vector-based entity approach to manage interactions with the environment and other objects.<br>
									Marc created the star power-up and assigned specific power-ups to each surprise block. He also implemented the camera system that follows Mario across the map and restricts his movement when reaching the edges of the screen. A simple scoring system was added, allowing the player to collect coins and increase their score. He introduced the Piranha Plant as a new enemy. Finally, Marc developed a system that automatically removes unnecessary entities at the end of each frame to optimize game performance.
								</p>

									<li>Implemented the collision system using a vector of entities.</li>

							<!-- Bernat section -->
							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h2>Bernat</h2>
								<p>
									Bernat was in charge of the visual design and user interface.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Designed sprite animations and background art.</li>
									<li>Created UI elements like menus and buttons.</li>
									<li>Implemented level transitions and scene management.</li>
									<li>Helped with level design and game feel.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<!-- Arshdeep section -->
							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h2>Arshdeep</h2>
								<p>
									Arshdeep was responsible for expanding the classic power-up mechanics and introducing the Fire Flower, as well as the associated fireball attack. Her work enriched gameplay variety by adding new visual effects and balanced power-up persistence. <br>
									Arshdeep created the animation for the Flower emerging from its block and ensured that Mario can collect it seamlessly. Once Mario has a Fire Flower, Arsh coded the ability to shoot fireballs, handling their motion, collisions with enemies, and removal when they hit a block or a Goomba. Finally, she made sure that Mario keeps his Fire Flower ability until he is hit by a Goomba, preventing players from staying overpowered indefinitely.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Crafted the emerging‐from‐block animation sequence.</li>
									<li>Implemented the Flower pick up logic.</li>
									<li>Spawn a fireball from Mario’s position.</li>
									<li>Program the fireball’s horizontal motion, gravity, and collision checks against blocks and Goombas.</li>
									<li>Integrated audio of fireballs.</li>
